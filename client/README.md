# ClientApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.0.

## Quick Start

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server (or `npm start`). Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Design

## NgRx

This project uses [NgRx](https://ngrx.io) for state management. More specifically, it uses the new style of actions and reducers based on `createAction` and `createReducer`. The docs on [https://ngrx.io](https://ngrx.io) aren't great for learning this new syntax, and most guides you will find use the olf, verbose style (if it looks a lot like redux, its the old style). The best resource for the new syntax is [this blog post](https://blog.angularindepth.com/ngrx-action-creators-redesigned-d396960e46da).

## Developing

### Modules

This project uses `npm`, so use `npm install <module>` to add a new module to the project.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Tests

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
